Nano Banana Pro Usage Examples

The examples below illustrate how to use Nano Banana Pro for different creative tasks. They leverage features described in Google’s announcement of the model.

1. Create a context‑rich infographic

To turn a recipe or concept into a visual guide, provide a clear description and ask for an infographic. For example:

Prompt: Create an infographic that shows how to make elaichi chai.

Expected outcome: Nano Banana Pro produces a step‑by‑step diagram with labeled stages and icons, illustrating the preparation of the cardamom tea

2. Generate multilingual packaging

If you have product packaging and want to translate the text while maintaining the design, you can instruct the model accordingly:

Prompt: Translate all the English text on the three yellow and blue cans into Korean, while keeping everything else the same.

Expected outcome: The image retains the original colors and layout, but all text appears correctly rendered in Korean

3. Blend multiple characters into a single scene

Nano Banana Pro can combine several input photos while preserving identities and style. Use prompts that specify the arrangement and artistic style:

Prompt: Put these five people and this dog into a single image; they should fit into a stunning award‑winning shot in the style of a fashion editorial. The identity of all five people and their attire and the dog must stay consistent throughout, but they can be seen from different angles and distances.

Expected outcome: The model blends the six subjects into a coherent composition that looks like a high‑fashion editorial photo

4. Adjust aspect ratio or lighting

After generating an image, you can refine it by altering the aspect ratio or scene lighting. Examples include:

Prompt: Change aspect ratio to 1:1 by reducing the background; the character remains exactly locked in its current position.

Expected outcome: Nano Banana Pro crops the background to a square format while keeping the subject fixed

Prompt: Turn this scene into nighttime.

Expected outcome: The model relights the scene to create a nighttime atmosphere, adjusting illumination and shadows accordingly

5. Design expressive typography and logos

Leverage Pro’s improved text rendering to create expressive typography:

Prompt: Make 8 minimalistic logos; each is an expressive word, and make letters convey a message or sound visually to express the meaning of this word in a dramatic way. Composition: flat vector rendering of all logos in black on a single white background.

Expected outcome: The output shows eight creative word‑logos where each letterform visually conveys the meaning or sound of the word

Tips for Creating Your Own Examples

Describe the desired scene clearly: Include subjects, background, mood and style.

Specify editing operations: Ask for translation, change of lighting, aspect ratio adjustments or other transformations.

Use multiple input images when needed: Pro can blend up to 14 images and preserve the resemblance of up to five people
